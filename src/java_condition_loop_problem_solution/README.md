### 2. Write a program according to the following output:

    ********************Welcome to the Guessing Game! ********************
    ********************A number is already generated. ********************
    *****To win, you have 5 chances to guess the generated number. *****

    Please, enter an Integer value that you can guess, between 1 to 100: 56 (User input)
    Your input is higher than the generated number.

    Please, enter an Integer value that you can guess, between 1 to 100: 23 (User input)
    Your input is higher than the generated number.

    Please, enter an Integer value that you can guess, between 1 to 100: 10 (User input)
    Your input is lower than the generated number.

    Please, enter an Integer value that you can guess, between 1 to 100: 21 (User input)
    Your input is higher than the generated number.

    Please, enter an Integer value that you can guess, between 1 to 100: 20 (User input)
    Great! You have guessed the correct number.

    Congratulation!! You win!!

### 7. Write a program to print prime numbers from 2 to n.

    Input: 
    12

    Output:
    2
    3

### 8. Write a program to generate 2 random numbers which will not be shown to the user. Take a user input and match it with any of the random numbers. If correct give it 1 point and if incorrect, do not give it any point. Finally, repeat this for 10 times and count the total points user achieved at the end of 10 cycle.

    To help you understand the problem, here is the explanation.

    In the first cycle, generated random numbers are 3, 19. (This generated numbers will not be shown to anyone)
    User inputs 4
    He does not get any point.

    In the second cycle, generated random numbers are 15, 7. (This generated numbers will not be shown to anyone)
    User inputs 7
    User gets 1 point.

    This process will be continued for 10 times. And finally, the total points are achieved by the user will be printed, like

    Your total point is 7!

    Input:
    23
    54
    12
    21
    67
    98
    q

    Output:
